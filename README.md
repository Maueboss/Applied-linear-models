**Climate Change Data Analysis**

This repository contains the code and analysis from my final assignment for a course taken during the first year, second term of my postgraduate program in Data Science. The project focuses on investigating the primary causes of global warming using a dataset comprising temperature, pollution indices, and natural disaster data across 17 representative countries.

The analysis explores the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions, climate factors, and their potential impacts on global temperatures. Data was collected from diverse sources, including the Climatic Research Unit (CRU TS), EM-DAT, and Our World in Data. I built a dataset and applied multiple regression models to estimate the influence of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and disaster-related economic damages on temperature variations.

I also performed diagnostic checks to validate model assumptions, assess collinearity, and identify influential data points. Future temperature trends were simulated based on methane emissions and other factors, providing a prediction for 2030.

Potential improvements include expanding the dataset to cover more countries and experimenting with advanced machine learning models to enhance predictive accuracy.
